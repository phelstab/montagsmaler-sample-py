== Introduction

Pictionary is a classic drawing and guessing game where one player draws a picture based on a randomly selected word, and other players try to guess what the word is. This implementation provides a networked multiplayer version with a simple graphical interface.

This entire project was written with Sourcegraph Cody (Claude 3.7 Sonnet extended thinking), including this README. The implementation consists of a client-server architecture where multiple players can connect to a central server to play together.

== Game Architecture

=== Components

The project is organized into three main components:

* *Client* (`client/client.py`): The GUI application that players interact with
* *Server* (`server/server.py`): The central game server that coordinates gameplay
* *Shared* (`shared/common.py`): Common utilities and constants used by both client and server

=== Game Flow

@startuml
[*] --> Waiting : Server started
Waiting --> Countdown : MIN_PLAYERS connected
Countdown --> Playing : Countdown finished
Playing --> RoundEnd : Word guessed correctly
Playing --> RoundEnd : Time limit reached
RoundEnd --> Playing : Start new round
Playing --> Waiting : Too few players

=== States

* *Waiting*: The server is waiting for enough players to join
* *Countdown*: A countdown before the game begins
* *Playing*: Active gameplay with one player drawing and others guessing
* *RoundEnd*: Brief period between rounds to show results

== Features

* Real-time drawing synchronized across all clients
* Chat functionality for guessing words
* Automatic role assignment (drawer/guesser)
* Score tracking for correct guesses
* Clear canvas functionality for the drawer
* Automatic handling of player disconnections
* Round-based gameplay with new words and drawers each round

== Setup and Installation

=== Requirements

* Python 3.6 or higher
* Tkinter (usually included with Python)

=== Installation

* Clone & setup the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/phelstab/montagsmaler-sample-py.git
cd montagsmaler-sample-py
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

=== Running the Game

* Start the server:

```sh
python -m server.server
```

* In a separate terminal window, start a client:

```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
python -m client.client
```

* Repeat step 2 in another terminal window to start a second client

* To play, wait for the countdown to start when at least 2 players have connected. The designated drawer will see a word to draw, and other players will try to guess it.


== How to Play

1. *As a Drawer*:
   * You'll be shown a word at the top of the screen
   * Use your mouse to draw that word on the canvas
   * The "Clear Canvas" button lets you erase your drawing and start over

2. *As a Guesser*:
   * Watch the drawing as it appears in real-time
   * Type your guesses in the text field at the bottom
   * Press Enter or click "Submit Guess" to send your guess
   * The first player to guess correctly wins the round

3. *Scoring*:
   * Guessers get 10 points for a correct guess
   * The drawer gets 5 points when someone correctly guesses their drawing

== Technical Details

=== Network Protocol

The client and server communicate using a simple JSON-based protocol over TCP sockets. Each message has a type and a data payload, separated by newlines to delimit messages.

=== Message Types

* `JOIN`: New player joining
* `DRAW`: Drawing data
* `CLEAR`: Clear canvas command
* `GUESS`: Player guess
* `STATE`: Game state update
* `COUNTDOWN`: Countdown timer update
* `RESULT`: Round result

=== Client Architecture

The client is built using Tkinter for the GUI with these main components:

* Drawing canvas
* Chat/guess display
* Player list
* Status indicators
* Input field for guesses

=== Server Architecture

The server manages:
* Client connections
* Game state
* Word selection
* Drawing synchronization
* Guess validation
* Score tracking

== Configuration

Game settings can be modified in `shared/common.py`:

* `HOST`: Server hostname (default: "localhost")
* `PORT`: Server port (default: 5555)
* `COUNTDOWN_SECONDS`: Time before a round starts (default: 5)
* `MIN_PLAYERS`: Minimum players required (default: 2)
* `WORDS`: List of words that can be selected for drawing

== Troubleshooting

* If the server won't start, check if the port is already in use
* If clients can't connect, verify the HOST setting in common.py
* If the GUI doesn't appear, ensure Tkinter is properly installed

== Potential Improvements

* Add a timer for each round
* Implement more sophisticated scoring based on guess time
* Add support for different colors and brush sizes
* Create a word category system
* Add sound effects and music
* Implement a proper login system
